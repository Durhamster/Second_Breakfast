This is a mod/plugin for The Lord of the Rings Online that allows the user to check whether it is meal time according Hobbit tradition.
By using this the player can ensure they do not miss their seven daily meals.

Second Breakfast adds the following in-game commands:

- /mealtime - Check if it is currently meal time.
- /listmeals - Displays list of all seven daily meals.

This [blog](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/1786/hobbit-meals-to-celebrate-hobbit-day.html) was used as a reference for the meal times.

*“If most of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.”* ― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Hobbit, or There and Back Again
